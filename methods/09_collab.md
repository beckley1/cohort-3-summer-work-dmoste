## Lesson
[Introduction to Functions](https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/cohort-3-summer-work-dmoste/blob/master/methods/collab_lesson.pdf): The lesson revolves around students building up functions that will eventually allow for the creation of a diamond shape. First students build the ability to create a single step, then an entire side, then a full diamond.

### Collaboration Technique
Pair Programming

### Benefits
When introducing functions in computer science, the teacher is adding an extremely abstract concept to the students' toolbox. With this high level of abstraction, providing students with the opportunity to act as both a driver and a navigator gives them an opportunity to grapple with the abstraction as well as implement it.

### Is It Working?
One way to check if the grouping is working is to use red, yellow, and green lights as indicators for how much a group is struggling. This provides an immediate visual for the teacher to see how groups are self-assessing and to get the general temperature of the room.

### Trouble Lurking
Groups should be set intentionally as homogeneous groups in order to best facilitate scaffolds and extra challenges. Some struggling students will certainly feel upset about being paired with another struggling student, but one way for the teacher to approach this problem is to make sure it is known that these groups will receive extra attention. This should be an implicit awareness built throughout the school year and not something stated directly by the teacher.

### Groupwork Instructions
* Driver is the only one typing
* Driver only types what the navigator says to type
* Driver and navigator will switch when prompted by the teacher (about every 10 minutes)
* Both participants should be able to explain what was typed
* Use the red, yellow, and green lights to indicate your current progress/understanding

### Long-Term Goals
The lesson is intended to help students understand the value of functions in computer programming. The groupwork will hopefully help students see the value in taking a step back and thinking about the alogrithm as we get into more and more abstract concepts as opposed to simply running through more simple tasks.
