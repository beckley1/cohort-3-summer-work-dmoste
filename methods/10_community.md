### Club: First Robotics (FRC)

#### How It Works
FRC is a robotics competition in which students form teams that build and program robots from scratch to perform a specific activity as part of a team of robots. Each year, a new challenge is created and teams build and program their new robots based on their own ideas!


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
FRC can be amazing for improving the computer science culture in a school for many reasons!

Initially, FRC provides students with an opportunity to participate in computer science without directly labeling it as CS. Since FRC is a robotics competition, the computer science aspect can be hidden inside of the robitcs framework. At the last school I taught as, there were always students that joined the team thinking they would work on some physical engineering aspect of the robot, only to find after they joined that the coding team was more interesting to them. I really think this is a great way to get students that don't think of themselves as coders or as capable of coding to get their foot in the door.

I also believe that the competition aspect of FRC provides a fun framework in which to participate in computer science .

#### Rollout Timeline
I can't imagine rolling out a genuine FRC team in less than two years. I think the first place to start is with a small, more informal robotics team. Something unaffiliated with FRC since FRC can be extremely daunting on first glance.

After a group of students that want to participate has been established for a year or so and some structure has been created, the next step would be to jump into the fray and officially create an FRC team. Even at this point though, it's important to remember that this new team will take time to grow and build into something significant.

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
Participation in CS courses is one way to see if FRC is having an impact, but I imagine a club such as FRC (which will take several years to really implement - as noted above) won't cause an immediate increase in CS enrollment. Therefore, I think the best way to gauge if FRC is having a positive impact on the school's CS community is to compare the participation list of the FRC programming group to the class lists for the CS courses and see if anyone is participating in FRC programming that hadn't enrolled in a CS course.

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
For my school, the largest hurdle will certainly be student time. The students at North Salem tend to overcommit to activities and very few of them actually have the time to make it to all of their commitments. Since FRC really requires an immense amou ntof after school work time, I can see this getting in the way.

One potential hurlde is to turn the club into a course. If the course met everyday for 40 minutes, a lot could be accomplished. This wouldn't entirely eliminate the need for after school work time, but it could reduce the requirement enough that the club becomes attainable for the student body.
